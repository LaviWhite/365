**Background:**

Throughout this Tracking User Engagement with SQL, Excel, and Python project, I worked with a real dataset from companyâ€™s data. 

The project required to analyze whether the new additions to the platform (new courses, exams, and career tracks) have increased student engagement.

**The following information were given:**

- Holder (student ID) and issuance date of certificates issued in Q2 2022

- Student ID and registration date of students registered between January 1, 2020 and June 30, 2022

- Student ID, product type, purchase date, and refund date (if applicable) of purchases made between January 1, 2020 and June 30, 2022

- Student watching (student ID), time watched, and date of courses watched in Q2 2021 and Q2 2022
